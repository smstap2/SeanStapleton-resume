        <p>
          I created this website as part of my professional development and coursework. It's built using semantic HTML, mobile-first CSS, and deployed using GitHub Pages.

          I'm actively seeking opportunities in IT support, network administration or engineering, and junior development roles. If you’re a recruiter or developer looking to connect, feel free to reach out!
